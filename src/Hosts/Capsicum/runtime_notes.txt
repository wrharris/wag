-required behavior:

  +loads WikiMedia splash screen

-RPC open per primitives enabled:

  +no primitives: loads WikiMedia splash screen

  +RPC: "Fatal error: Class 'MediaWiki' not found in
  /usr/local/www/mediawiki/index.php on line 57"

  +capenter: "No input file specified."

    -not surprising: putting PHP in cap mode and then not RPCing open

  +RPC, capenter: "No input file specified."

  +hunch: No input file specified is triggered by failures in access
   or fstat.

-problem: internal server error

  +past fix: don't do anything funny with multiple roots launching
   apache

  +past fix: may be opening a bad log file

-problem: code generator fails when building a load

  +past fix: make sure that main has argc, argv arguments
